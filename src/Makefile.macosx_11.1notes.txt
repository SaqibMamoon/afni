cd ~/src/afni/src
make vastness

Install
 1. gcc not yet available (use Clang)
 2. OpenMP for Clang must be installed
  a. EITHER Install precompiled version: https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/
  b. OR compile your own
		git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
		cd llvm-project/openmp; mkdir build; cd build 
		cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='arm64;x86_64' .. 
		 make install  
 3. Some libraries will need to be generated
  a. Motif must be installed as native library
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s motif
	  Creates files in "/opt/local/include" and "/opt/local/lib"
  b. Unable to install lXpm as native library
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s libxpm
	 Creates files in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libxpm"
  c. files in ./avovk (e.g. 3dkmeans) require gsl
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s gsl
	 Creates files in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.6/include" and "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gsl/2.6/lib"
  d. Suma requires glib must be installed as native library. This will require python3.9, which is not yet available for the M1
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s glib
	 Creates files in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/glib/2.66.2_1/include" and "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/glib/2.66.2_1/lib"
  e. Suma requires libGLU and libGL. The versions included with XQuartz (2.7.11, /opt/X11/lib/libGLU.dylib and /opt/X11/lib/libGL.dylib) are not ARM native.
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
      brew install -s libGLU       
	 Creates libGLU.dylib in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/mesa-glu/9.0.1/include" and "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/mesa-glu/9.0.1/lib" 
	 It also creates libGL.dylib in "/opt/homebrew/opt/mesa/include" and "/opt/homebrew/opt/mesa/lib"
  f. Suma requires <X11/XInput.h>:
      export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
	  brew install -s libxi
	 Creates files in "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libxi/1.7.10/include" and "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libxi/1.7.10/lib"
 4. while the headers are not required to compile "vastness", AFNI wants to copy these libraries to the executable folder - perhaps they are dependencies?	
    export ARCHFLAGS='-arch arm64'
	brew install -s freetype
    brew install -s glib
	
  7. brew is unable to create several libraries that the AFNI makefile wants to copy. It is unclear if these are linked to any executables:
	cp: /usr/local/lib/gcc/8/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib: No such file or directory
	cp: /usr/local/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib: No such file or directory
	cp: /usr/local/lib/libbz2.1.dylib: No such file or directory
	cp: /usr/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib: No such file or directory
	libpython*.dylib not native (makefile does not define "LDPYTHON" but not required to build executables)
